```


Reminder: There is a "Markdown Help" page available in RStudio. 


## In-class Activity, Markdown

Below the "Your work here" section header, do the following 3 things. To turn this in, knit the RMarkdown file, and zip and submit the html.  

1. Make a subsection called "Wise words". Put your favorite quote in a block quote. Add a functioning link to a website that provides more information about that quote.

## Wise words
```
> Start with GOD â€” the first step in learning is bowing down to GOD; only fools thumb their noses at such wisdom and learning.Proverb 1:7 
[Proverbs 1:7](https://www.bible.com/bible/97/PRO.1.7.MSG)
```


2. Make a subsection called "My semester". Make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (put those in __bold__), course title (put those in _italics_), and instructor name.

## My Semester
|**Course Number**| *Course Title* |Instructor Name|
|:--------------|:---------------|:--------------|
|**CS2311**|*Data Information and Structures*|John Henderson|
|**DS2401**|*Data Science*|Katherine Shoemaker|



3. Lastly, make subsection called "I recommend", and add some information about your favorite author or musician.

+ A _subsubheading_ with the name of the artist or author;    
+ An example of their writing or lyrics (formatted in a *plain code block*);   
+ A _list_ of things they have written or performed (remember to use the formatting markup for a list!).     

## I Recommend 
### "Joji"

```
The sun is not the brightest thing
The choir sings
To an empty world of finer things
Even though it burns, you drown and sink
You know I am
Washing over you
Washing over you
```
### Songs

**- YUKON (Interlude)**

**- Sanctuary**

**- Why Am I Still in LA**
